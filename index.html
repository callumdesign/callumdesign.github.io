            <p class="paragraph" id="collapse">I studied at Victoria University, and completed a bachelor of design innovation majoring in industrial design in 2017. I have had three years of experience using CAD packages such as <span class="colortext">Solidworks and Rhinoceros</span> to design for additive manufacturing technologies as well as other CNC machining techniques. My area of expertise is designing for additive manufacturing. I have a keen eye for attention to detail regarding design. I take a pragmatic approach to problems, and attempt to arrive at a solution which does not sacrifice usability or complicate the final solution simply to add aesthetic value. Some practical attributes I have include hands on experience operating consumer level <span class="colortext">3D printers</span> such as the UP! Box FDM machines, as well as designing parts to be made on printers such as the Stratasys J750 and Connex printers. I also have experience using rendering software such as <span class="colortext">Keyshot</span>, to produce images and animations of prototypes to demonstrate features of a design.<br><br></p>

Currently my main interest in this field is responsive web design, and learning to create unique user experiences which work on computers and mobile devices. I have used Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop to create simple flat UI style vector graphics and glyphs for websites. I also have experience using Arduino & Raspberry Pi with IR motion sensors, heat & moisture sensors, and NEMA stepping motors to create interactive projects. I have some knowledge of <span class="colortext">C/C++ and Python</span>. I am experienced with basic workshop machinery such as table/band/mitre saws, drill press and hand tools as well as basic bogging/priming and spray-painting experience.</p>

                  <p class="portfoliotext"> With the ability to leave your scooter unattended as it charges, it is important to ensure that it is securely locked up until the owner is ready to retrieve it. For this reason, the bench has been designed to use a locking system to keep the scooter safely contained for a set duration of time. The system is comprised of several locking doorways which each lead to a cavity beneath the bench in which the scooter can be securely housed.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="item">
                  <p class="portfoliotext">Since it is possible for many different people to come and go while using the recharge station, the method for setting the lock would be customisable for each person. For this reason, a conceptual app was theorised which connects a digital locking system via wifi or bluetooth to the user's smart phone. Such a system may also be used to alert the user when their scooter is fully charged or when other users are waiting to use the recharge station. Since the scooter may be left for a long period of time during charging, each scooter compartment would need to be weatherproof and unable to be tampered with, to keep the scooter safe and secure. Along with the smartphone locking method, each compartment would be protected against vandalism or theft by using a double thickness steel doorway.</p>
